# A-simple-Food-Ordering-Application-using-python
A simple app to help food vendor customers order food

This is a **Python-based food ordering app** built inside a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).  
Itâ€™s a simple, interactive program that lets you:
- View a menu of available food items and prices
- Pick what you want and how many
- See your total bill in a receipt format

Itâ€™s designed for a food vendor who sells **Pizza**, **Burger**, and **Noodles**.

## Menu & Prices
----- MENU -----
1. Pizza - â‚¦6500
2. Burger - â‚¦3000
3. Noodles - â‚¦1300
4. Exit & Checkout
5.

##  How it works
When you run the notebook:
1. The menu is displayed.
2. You choose an item by entering its number.
3. You enter the quantity you want.
4. You can keep adding items until you choose to check out.
5. At checkout, you get a receipt showing:
   - Each item ordered
   - Quantity
   - Total price per item
   - Grand total

If you check out without ordering anything, it will simply say:
```
Your cart is empty. No items to check out.
```
